# pressure_budget_kilauea2020
Estimate Kilauea's Halemaumau magma reservoir pressure change from 2018 to 2020, using summit deformation and magma surge data.

Scripts under the directory "projects" produce figures in the following publication:
Segall, P., Anderson, K. R., Wang T. A. Could Kilaueaâ€™s 2020 post caldera-forming eruption have been anticipated?: Geophysical Research Letters (2022).

## Scripts under /projects
### 1. surges.m
Model surges in LERZ during 2018 Kilauea caldera collapse

### 2. cmp_dp_uncertainty.m
Invert for post-2018 pressure changes

### 3. Dp_distributions.m
Make probability plots of pressure change at Kilauea for 2018 to December 20 2020.

### 4. ThresholdTimeDistr.m
Determine time to threshold pressure for Kilauea eruption in 2020
